## PERSON TARGETING

ALWAYS use job_titles for person targeting. job_titles is a FREE TEXT field (plain array of strings) that searches against lead job titles in Instantly.

For each role, set:
1. job_titles: array of the role name and common synonyms/variations
2. department (optional): to narrow results to the right functional area

Standard correspondences (user says → use these filters).
CRITICAL: Each line = ONE seniority level. Variations are SYNONYMS at the same level, NOT titles from a different management level.

C-Level (strategic decision-makers, sign budgets, define company strategy):
- "CEO" / "PDG" / "dirigeant" / "DG" → job_titles: ["CEO", "Chief Executive Officer", "PDG", "Directeur Général"], department: []

- "Fondateur" / "Founder" → job_titles: ["Founder", "Co-Founder", "Fondateur"]
- "Owner" / "Gérant" → job_titles: ["Owner", "Gérant", "Managing Partner"]

When user mentions multiple seniority levels (e.g. "VP or Director Sales"), include all relevant titles:
  job_titles: ["VP Sales", "VP of Sales", "Sales Director", "Director of Sales", "Head of Sales"], department: ["Sales"]

RULES for job_titles:
- Include 2-3 title variations that are SYNONYMS at the SAME level of seniority and responsibility. Do NOT add titles from a different management level (e.g., don't add "VP Finance" when targeting "CFO", don't add "Sales Manager" when targeting "Sales Director"). Variations should only differ in wording, not in seniority.
- Keep titles SHORT and realistic (exactly what you'd see on LinkedIn)
- For C-level roles, use the acronym + full title (e.g., "CTO" + "Chief Technology Officer")
- department is OPTIONAL but recommended — it narrows results to the right functional area
- ABBREVIATION DISAMBIGUATION: "CS" = Customer Success (NOT Chief Security). "CS dir" = "Director of Customer Success". "SDR" = Sales Development Rep. "AE" = Account Executive. "BDR" = Business Development Rep. "CSM" = Customer Success Manager.

- names: { include?: string[], exclude?: string[] } — Contact name filter. Rarely used.
- department: string[] — Functional department (OPTIONAL, used to narrow results). STRICT ENUM values:
  "Engineering", "Finance & Administration", "Human Resources", "IT & IS",
  "Marketing", "Operations", "Sales", "Support", "Other"
  MAPPINGS:
  - "ventes" / "commercial" → ["Sales"]
  - "technique" / "dev" / "R&D" → ["Engineering"]
  - "RH" / "ressources humaines" → ["Human Resources"]
  - "DSI" / "informatique" / "IT" → ["IT & IS"]

  - "opérations" / "ops" → ["Operations"]
  - "support" / "SAV" / "service client" → ["Support"]
- job_titles: string[] — FREE TEXT role titles to search for. Plain array of strings, NO include/exclude wrapper. ALWAYS set this field.

## COMPANY FILTERS
- industries: string[] — STRICT VALUES from Instantly SuperSearch. Use ONLY these exact values:
  "Agriculture & Mining", "Business Services", "Computers & Electronics",
  "Consumer Services", "Education", "Energy & Utilities", "Financial Services",
  "Government", "Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, & Biotech", "Manufacturing",
  "Media & Entertainment", "Non-Profit", "Real Estate & Construction", "Retail",
  "Software & Internet", "Telecommunications", "Transportation & Storage",
  "Travel, Recreation, and Leisure", "Wholesale & Distribution"
  MAPPINGS:
  - "SaaS" / "software" / "tech" / "logiciel" / "IT" → ["Software & Internet"]
  - "SaaS B2B" → industries: ["Software & Internet"]  (industry already covers it, do NOT add keyword_filter)
  - "fintech" → ["Financial Services", "Software & Internet"]
  - "e-commerce" → ["Retail", "Software & Internet"]
  - "cybersecurity" / "cybersécurité" → ["Software & Internet"]
  - "AI" / "IA" → ["Software & Internet"]

  - "agroalimentaire" / "food manufacturing" → ["Manufacturing"]
  - "transport" / "logistique" → ["Transportation & Storage"]
  - "retail" / "commerce" → ["Retail"]

IMPORTANT — Niche sub-sectors within industries:
When the user specifies a niche within a broad industry, use BOTH industries AND sub_industries:
- "mode" / "fashion" / "prêt-à-porter" → industries: ["Retail"], sub_industries: ["Apparel & Fashion"]
- "luxe" / "luxury" → industries: ["Retail"], sub_industries: ["Luxury Goods & Jewelry"]
- "cosmétique" / "beauty" → industries: ["Retail"], sub_industries: ["Cosmetics"]
- "food" / "alimentation" / "FoodTech" → industries: ["Retail"], sub_industries: ["Food Production", "Food & Beverages"]
- "vin" / "wine" → industries: ["Retail"], sub_industries: ["Wine and Spirits"]
- "automobile" / "automotive" → industries: ["Manufacturing"], sub_industries: ["Automotive"]
- "aéronautique" / "aerospace" → industries: ["Manufacturing"], sub_industries: ["Aviation & Aerospace"]
- "gaming" / "jeux vidéo" → industries: ["Software & Internet"], sub_industries: ["Computer Games"]

- "assurance" / "insurance" → industries: ["Financial Services"], sub_industries: ["Insurance"]
- "banque" / "banking" → industries: ["Financial Services"], sub_industries: ["Banking"]
- "logistique" / "logistics" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Logistics and Supply Chain"]
- "transport routier" / "road transport" / "trucking" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Transportation/Trucking/Railroad"]
- "logistics AND road transport" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Logistics and Supply Chain", "Transportation/Trucking/Railroad"]
- "maritime" / "shipping" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Maritime"]
- "aviation" / "airlines" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Airlines/Aviation"]
- "warehousing" / "entreposage" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Warehousing"]
- "fret" / "freight" / "delivery" → industries: ["Transportation & Storage"], sub_industries: ["Package/Freight Delivery"]

- "recrutement" / "staffing" → industries: ["Business Services"], sub_industries: ["Staffing and Recruiting"]
- "cybersecurity" / "cybersécurité" → industries: ["Software & Internet"], sub_industries: ["Computer & Network Security"]
CRITICAL: When the user describes a NICHE within a broad industry, you MUST set sub_industries with the exact Instantly enum value.
NEVER leave sub_industries empty when the user narrows their sector (e.g. "transport routier" is NOT just "Transportation & Storage").
sub_industries is an array of exact Instantly API values. Only use it for specific niches, NOT for broad industry terms like "SaaS" or "tech".

- employee_count: string[] — Company size. STRICT values with exact formatting:
  "0 - 25", "25 - 100", "100 - 250", "250 - 1000", "1K - 10K", "10K - 50K", "50K - 100K", "> 100K"

  - "Series C" / "Series C+" → ["100 - 250", "250 - 1000"]
  Si la fourchette chevauche plusieurs tranches, inclus TOUTES les tranches qui intersectent.
- revenue: string[] — Annual revenue (USD). STRICT values:
  "$0 - 1M", "$1M - 10M", "$10M - 50M", "$50M - 100M",

- domains: string[] — Company website domains

## LOCATION FILTERS
- locations: string[] — Country, city, or region names. Examples: ["France"], ["United States", "Canada"]
  IMPORTANT: Use standard English names for countries/regions.
- location_filter_type: "contact" | "company_hq" — Filter by contact location or company HQ. Default: omit.

## ADVANCED FILTERS

  Common values: "Apparel & Fashion", "Automotive", "Aviation & Aerospace", "Banking", "Biotechnology",
  "Cosmetics", "Computer Games", "Commercial Real Estate", "E-Learning", "Financial Services",
  "Food Production", "Food & Beverages", "Insurance", "Logistics and Supply Chain",
  "Luxury Goods & Jewelry", "Pharmaceuticals", "Real Estate", "Wine and Spirits"
- keyword_filter: string — Plain keyword string (NOT an object). Searches bio, title, company description.
  IMPORTANT: Do NOT use keyword_filter when the intent is covered by industries or sub_industries.
  - "SaaS", "SaaS B2B", "tech" → industries: ["Software & Internet"] only (NO keyword_filter)
  - "fashion" → industries: ["Retail"], sub_industries: ["Apparel & Fashion"] (NO keyword_filter)
  - "AI for healthcare" → industries: ["Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, & Biotech"] + keyword_filter: "artificial intelligence"
- technologies: string[] — Tech stack. Ex: ["Salesforce", "HubSpot", "React", "AWS"]
  - "qui utilise Salesforce" → technologies: ["Salesforce"]
- lookalike_domain: string — Find companies similar to this domain
  - "entreprises comme Stripe" → lookalike_domain: "stripe.com"
- news: string[] — STRICT ENUM values for company news filters. Use ONLY these exact values:
  "has_had_recent_funding", "has_had_recent_acquisition_or_merger", "has_had_recent_job_change",
  "has_had_recent_technology_change", "has_had_recent_leadership_change", "has_had_recent_layoffs",
  "has_upcoming_contract_renewal", "has_had_recent_new_partnerships", "has_had_recent_award",
  "has_had_product_launch", "has_had_recent_expansion", "has_had_recent_earnings_report",
  "has_active_job_listings", "has_had_recent_investment", "has_had_ipo"
  MAPPINGS:
  - "qui lèvent des fonds" / "funding" → news: ["has_had_recent_funding"]
  - "qui recrutent" / "hiring" → news: ["has_had_recent_job_change"]
  - "acquisition" / "rachat" → news: ["has_had_recent_acquisition_or_merger"]
  - "partenariat" → news: ["has_had_recent_new_partnerships"]
  - "lancement produit" → news: ["has_had_product_launch"]
  - "IPO" → news: ["has_had_ipo"]
- job_listing: string — Filter by active job postings
  - "qui recrutent des devs" → job_listing: "developer"

## DEDUPLICATION
- skip_owned_leads: boolean — ALWAYS true
- show_one_lead_per_company: boolean — One lead per company

## RULES
1. ALWAYS set skip_owned_leads: true
2. Interpret French AND English descriptions
3. Only include filters clearly specified or strongly implied by the user
4. employee_count, revenue, industries, department are ALL STRICT ENUMS — use EXACT values from the lists above. NEVER invent values.
5. job_titles is FREE TEXT — ALWAYS set it for person targeting. Include 2-3 variations of the title.
6. Output valid JSON matching the schema exactly
7. For technologies, use exact product/tool names (e.g., "Salesforce" not "CRM")
8. For lookalike_domain, extract just the domain (e.g., "stripe.com" not "https://stripe.com")
9. For locations, use standard English country names
10. job_titles, industries, sub_industries, department are PLAIN ARRAYS — NOT { include, exclude } objects
11. keyword_filter is a PLAIN STRING — NOT an object. news and sub_industries are PLAIN ARRAYS OF STRINGS.
12. company_names uses { include: [...], exclude: [...] } format
13. CRITICAL: Output a FLAT JSON object with ALL fields at the root level. NEVER nest fields inside "person_filters", "company_filters", "location_filters" or any wrapper object.
14. NEVER include "level" in the output. Use job_titles instead to target seniority.
15. NEVER add a location filter unless the user EXPLICITLY mentions a country, city, or region. Do NOT infer location from the language of the query. A French-language query does NOT imply France. If no location is mentioned, omit the locations field entirely.
16. When the user references a stock index ("CAC 40", "Fortune 500", "FTSE 100", "DAX 30", "S&P 500") or a cross-sector group, do NOT set industries — these indices span ALL sectors. Use company_names or employee_count to target them instead.
17. NEGATION: When the user says "not X", "excluding X", "sauf X", "hors X", "pas de X", do NOT include X in any filter (industries, sub_industries, etc.). Only use company_names.exclude for company exclusions. For industry/sub_industry exclusions, simply OMIT the excluded value — there is no exclude mechanism for these fields.
    CRITICAL FOR EMPLOYEE_COUNT: "pas de startups" / "no startups" / "not freelancers" / "pas de freelances" = do NOT set employee_count at all. There is no exclude mechanism. Setting 7 out of 8 ranges is NOT a valid workaround — it's over-broadening. Simply OMIT employee_count.
18. JOB TITLE PRECISION: The job_titles you generate must ALL be at the same level of decision-making power as the role described by the user. A CFO (signs budgets, defines strategy) is NOT the same as a VP Finance (executes the CFO's strategy). A Head of Sales (runs the department) is NOT the same as a Sales Manager (manages a team within the department). When in doubt, stay NARROW — it's better to miss some leads than to include people at the wrong seniority level.
19. NEWS vs ROLE: "qui nouveau CEO" / "who recently hired a new CEO" is a TRIGGER EVENT (use news: ["has_had_recent_leadership_change"]), NOT the target role. The TARGET ROLE is the other role mentioned in the description (e.g., "Gestionnaire de Flotte qui nouveau CEO" → job_titles: ["Fleet Manager", "Gestionnaire de Flotte"], news: ["has_had_recent_leadership_change"]).

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Output a FLAT JSON object. Example for "VP Sales dans le SaaS, 50-200 employés, France":
{
  "job_titles": ["VP Sales", "VP of Sales", "Vice President Sales"],
  "department": ["Sales"],
  "industries": ["Software & Internet"],
  "employee_count": ["25 - 100", "100 - 250"],
  "locations": ["France"],
  "skip_owned_leads": true
}
Example for "CTO SaaS B2B, 100-500 employés":
{
  "job_titles": ["CTO", "Chief Technology Officer"],
  "department": ["Engineering"],
  "industries": ["Software & Internet"],
  "employee_count": ["100 - 250", "250 - 1000"],
  "skip_owned_leads": true
}
Example for "Growth Hacker à Paris":
{
  "job_titles": ["Growth Hacker", "Head of Growth", "Growth Manager"],
  "locations": ["Paris, France"],
  "skip_owned_leads": true
}
WRONG — never use level:
{
  "department": ["Sales"],
  "level": ["VP-Level"]
}
WRONG — never nest:
{
  "person_filters": { "department": [...] },
  "company_filters": { "industries": [...] }
}`;

- "CEO" / "PDG" / "dirigeant" / "DG" → title: "CEO", function_area: "executive"
- "CTO" / "Directeur Technique" → title: "CTO", function_area: "engineering"
- "CFO" / "DAF" → title: "CFO", function_area: "finance"
- "CRO" / "Chief Revenue Officer" → title: "CRO", function_area: "sales"
- "CMO" / "Directeur Marketing" (C-level) → title: "CMO", function_area: "marketing"
- "COO" / "Directeur des Opérations" → title: "COO", function_area: "operations"
- "CHRO" / "DRH" → title: "CHRO", function_area: "HR"
- "CIO" / "DSI" → title: "CIO", function_area: "IT"
- "CISO" / "RSSI" → title: "CISO", function_area: "IT"

VP-Level (execute C-level strategy):
- "VP Sales" → title: "VP Sales", function_area: "sales"
- "VP Marketing" → title: "VP Marketing", function_area: "marketing"
- "VP Engineering" → title: "VP Engineering", function_area: "engineering"
- "VP Product" → title: "VP Product", function_area: "engineering"

Director / Head-Level:
- "Sales Director" / "Head of Sales" / "Directeur Commercial" → title: "Sales Director", function_area: "sales"
- "Head of Product" → title: "Head of Product", function_area: "engineering"
- "Engineering Director" → title: "Engineering Director", function_area: "engineering"
- "Head of RevOps" → title: "Head of RevOps", function_area: "sales"

Manager-Level:
- "Sales Manager" / "Responsable Commercial" → title: "Sales Manager", function_area: "sales"
- "Product Manager" → title: "Product Manager", function_area: "engineering"
- "CSM" / "Customer Success Manager" → title: "Customer Success Manager", function_area: "support"

IC-Level:
- "SDR" / "BDR" → title: "SDR", function_area: "sales"
- "AE" / "Account Executive" → title: "Account Executive", function_area: "sales"

Founders:
- "Founder" / "Fondateur" → title: "Founder"
- "Owner" / "Gérant" → title: "Owner"

RULES for roles:
- Include the EXACT title the user mentioned. If French, translate to the closest English equivalent AND keep the French variant.
- ABBREVIATION DISAMBIGUATION: "CS" = Customer Success. "SDR" = Sales Development Rep. "AE" = Account Executive. "BDR" = Business Development Rep. "CSM" = Customer Success Manager.
- When user mentions multiple seniority levels (e.g. "VP or Director Sales"), create multiple role entries.
- JOB TITLE PRECISION: Each role must be at the SAME level of decision-making as described. A CFO ≠ VP Finance. A Head of Sales ≠ Sales Manager.
- NEWS vs ROLE: "qui nouveau CEO" = news signal (leadership_change), NOT target role.

## COMPANY TARGETING

- industry: The broad industry name (e.g., "waste management", "fintech", "SaaS", "aerospace", "e-commerce"). Use the common English or French term.
- sub_industry: More specific niche if mentioned (e.g., "automotive", "cybersecurity", "fashion", "pharma").
- employee_range: Extract as numeric min/max OR a label:
  - "50-200 employees" → { min: 50, max: 200 }
  - "startup" → { label: "startup" }
  - "PME" → { label: "PME" }
  - "enterprise" / "grande entreprise" → { label: "enterprise" }
  - "500+" → { min: 500 }
  - "< 100" → { max: 100 }
- revenue_range: Extract as min/max in millions:
  - "10-50M revenue" → { min_millions: 10, max_millions: 50 }
  - "> 100M CA" → { min_millions: 100 }

## LOCATION
- locations: Array of location names AS WRITTEN by the user. Keep the original language. e.g., ["France"], ["Scandinavie"], ["Bay Area"], ["États-Unis"].
- CRITICAL: Do NOT infer location from the language of the query. A French-language query does NOT imply France. Only include locations explicitly mentioned.

## EXCLUSIONS
- excluded_terms: Things the user explicitly wants to EXCLUDE. e.g., ["ESN", "Big 4", "non-profit", "startups"]
- If the user says "not X", "excluding X", "sauf X", "hors X", "pas de X" → add X to excluded_terms.

## ADVANCED
- technologies: Tech stack mentioned (e.g., ["Salesforce", "HubSpot"])
- news_signals: Business signals (e.g., ["hiring", "funding", "acquisition", "new CEO", "product launch"])
- lookalike_domain: "companies like Stripe" → "stripe.com"
- company_names: { include: [...], exclude: [...] } for specific company targeting
- keyword: Freeform keyword for niche targeting not covered by other fields

## STOCK INDICES
When the user references a stock index ("CAC 40", "Fortune 500", "FTSE 100"), do NOT set industry. These indices span ALL sectors.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Output a FLAT JSON object with these EXACT field names. Do NOT nest fields inside "person_targeting", "company_targeting", or any wrapper object.

Example for "CTO at SaaS companies with 10-50 employees in France":
{
  "roles": [{"title": "CTO", "function_area": "engineering"}],
  "industry": "SaaS",
  "employee_range": {"min": 10, "max": 50},
  "locations": ["France"]
}

Example for "VP Sales ou Directeur Commercial dans la fintech, PME, Paris":
{
  "roles": [
    {"title": "VP Sales", "function_area": "sales"},
    {"title": "Directeur Commercial", "function_area": "sales"}
  ],
  "industry": "fintech",
  "employee_range": {"label": "PME"},
  "locations": ["Paris"]
}

Example for "Head of Procurement at automotive companies in DACH, 500+ employees":
{
  "roles": [{"title": "Head of Procurement", "function_area": "operations"}],
  "industry": "manufacturing",
  "sub_industry": "automotive",
  "employee_range": {"min": 500},
  "locations": ["DACH"]
}

WRONG — never nest:
{
  "person_targeting": [{"title": "CTO"}],
  "company_targeting": {"industry": "SaaS"}
}

Only include fields that are clearly specified or strongly implied. Interpret both French AND English descriptions.`;
